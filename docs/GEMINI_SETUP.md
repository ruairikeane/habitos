## 🧠 How It Works

### **For New Users (0 habits)**
- AI suggests foundational keystone habits
- Focus on simple, momentum-building activities
- Categories balanced across lifestyle areas

### **For Growing Users (1-5 habits)**
- Analyzes existing habit patterns
- Suggests complementary habits in same categories
- Identifies missing life balance areas
- Provides habit stacking opportunities

### **For Advanced Users (6+ habits)**
- Deep pattern analysis and optimization suggestions
- Advanced habit stacking with existing routines
- Lifestyle-specific recommendations
- Strategic habit timing and batching

## 🎯 AI Features

### **Intelligent Analysis**
```typescript
// The AI analyzes:
- Habit names and patterns
- Category distribution
- Time patterns (morning/evening habits)
- Stacking opportunities with existing habits
- Missing foundational areas
```

### **Personalized Reasoning**
Every suggestion includes:
- **Why**: Specific reasoning based on user's habits
- **How**: Stacking opportunities with existing routines
- **When**: Optimal timing recommendations
- **Difficulty**: Progressive challenge levels

### **Dynamic Updates**
- Suggestions refresh when habits change
- Real-time analysis of new patterns
- Evolving complexity as user grows

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Fallback System**
- If API is unavailable → smart hardcoded suggestions
- If parsing fails → graceful error handling
- Offline mode → static intelligent suggestions

### **Prompt Engineering**
The AI receives structured prompts with:
- Current habit list with categories and frequency
- User preferences (time available, focus areas)
- Request for specific JSON response format
- Guidelines for habit coach expertise

### **Response Structure**
```typescript
interface AIAnalysis {
  suggestions: HabitSuggestion[];  // 4-6 specific habits
  insights: string[];              // Pattern observations
  habitPatterns: string[];         // Behavior analysis
  recommendations: string[];       // Strategic advice
}
```
