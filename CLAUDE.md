## Critical Development Rules

### NEVER ADD DEBUGGING TOOLS TO PRODUCTION APP
- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: Never add debug buttons, diagnostic tools, or developer utilities to the production app interface
- **USER EXPERIENCE**: The app must always look professional and clean for end users
- **DEBUGGING APPROACH**: Debug issues by examining code, logs, and data directly - not by adding UI tools
- **PRODUCTION READY**: Every commit should result in a production-ready app interface

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (~3.32.8) with Dart (~3.6.0)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore) - Ready for integration
- **State Management**: Provider pattern with feature-based providers
- **Navigation**: GoRouter for declarative routing
- **UI**: Custom components with earth-tone theme system
- **Platform**: iOS-first development (iPhone testing)

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Primary Storage**: Firebase Firestore (ready for integration)
2. **Offline Fallback**: Local SQLite database (planned)
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background sync
4. **Date Handling**: Local timezone operations via `dateHelpers.dart`

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Feature-Based Organization
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/              # Core utilities, themes, constants
â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # Models and data structures
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/        # App routing configuration  
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/      # UI layer (screens, widgets, providers)
â””â”€â”€ main.dart         # App entry point
```

#### 2. Provider Pattern
```dart
// State management with Provider
class HabitsProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  List<Habit> _habits = [];
  // Business logic and state updates
}
```

#### 3. GoRouter Navigation
```dart
// Declarative routing with nested routes
GoRoute(
  path: '/habits',
  builder: (context, state) => const HabitsScreen(),
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: 'add',
      builder: (context, state) => const AddHabitScreen(),
    ),
  ],
),
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Earth-Tone Color System
- **Primary Colors**: Browns, beiges, earth yellows
- **NO BLUE COLORS**: Replaced with warm sand tones
- **Psychology Category**: Dark earthy orange (#B87333)
- **Category Colors**: Each habit category has unique earth-tone color

### Date/Time Handling
**IMPORTANT**: Always use local timezone, not UTC
```dart
import '../../core/utils/date_helpers.dart';
// Returns YYYY-MM-DD in local timezone
final today = DateHelpers.getTodayLocalDate();
```

### Typography System
- **Font**: System default for friendly appearance
- **Sizes**: Reduced for softer, more approachable look
- **Weights**: w500-w600 instead of bold for gentler appearance

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Firebase Configuration (when integrated)
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# AI Integration
EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

### Testing on Device
1. Connect iPhone via USB-C
2. Run `~/flutter/bin/flutter devices` to verify connection
3. Run `~/flutter/bin/flutter run -d "00008120-000A21AE1482201E"`
4. App launches directly on device
